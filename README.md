This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl: accessing an array element using an index that is out of bounds.  The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version.  The error results in undefined behavior, potentially crashing the program or producing incorrect results.  The solution emphasizes the importance of bounds checking before accessing array elements.
